== Transgress

The ones who most need to access trans-related services and information, the most vulnerable among us, are often the ones
with the least access to these sites. As governments and public networks begin to add content filtering services to their
open networks, transient trans people and trans youth who have not come out find their access to critical resources dwindling.
Many content systems overzealously block sites even tangentially mentioning trans people or the issues they face. When
sites offering information that could help ease a person's sense of isolation or suffering are blocked, it directly impacts
their safety in a very real sense.

Transgress is a simple, easy-to-use proxy service that allows people to access sites that are relevant to trans people.
It requests a site from an unfiltered location, checks to see if it is relevant to trans issues, replaces any potentially
flagged words, and sends the page on to the requester. In addition to the standard content of the page, a javascript file
is also included, that, upon the page loading completely, repairs the word replacements, restoring the content to its
original state. Any links and content that is part of the site being browsed, is also run through transgress, so you should
be able to browse, as normal, without worrying about any technical details.

Built into the system is a relatively simple content checking service. If a site does not appear to be related to trans
issues and people, the page served up will be a simple page describing the fact that this service should not be used for
unintended purposes. This should hopefully prevent the service from being flagged by content filter providers as potentially
problematic. It is my hope, that if this service is flagged, that another instance can be created for continued public usage.
Furthermore, such a banning could be a jumping off point to begin discussing with these providers about how these services
can harm already disadvantaged people, and create a dialogue for balancing security and safety in a responsible manner.

== How YOU can help

It is my hope that Transgress will continue to develop to become increasingly robust so that those who need the resources
available on the internet can access them in a safe and convenient way.

Feel free to contact the maintainers of this project by opening an issue in the github repo located at
https://github.com/Valarissa/transgress

Pull requests are also, not only welcome, but actively encouraged!

If you know quite a bit about cross-site scripting, I'd love to talk to see if it would be possible to address certain XSS
issues currently present. If you want some additional feature of some sort, by all means, create an issue and we'll talk about
the potential of adding it!

Adding a new term to search for or replace is INCREDIBLY easy. Just add things to
https://github.com/Valarissa/transgress/blob/master/lib/assets/javascripts/string_list.json
and send the additions as a pull request. That's it. SUPER simple. With a few more additions to the JS code and some changes
to the views, this project will be working as it's intended.
